**# Intensity-Analysis**
Project Overview
The Intensity Analysis project is focused on classifying text data into three emotional categories: 'angriness,' 'happiness,' and 'sadness.' The project involves preprocessing the text data, engineering features, and building a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict the emotional intensity from the text.

**Data Description**
The datasets consist of text samples labeled with one of three emotions: 'angriness,' 'happiness,' or 'sadness.' Each dataset contains text data that is preprocessed and used to train a model capable of predicting the emotional intensity of new text inputs.

**Methodology
Data Preprocessing:**

Exploration: Checked for missing values and basic statistics.
Cleaning: Applied techniques like lowercasing, removal of special characters, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization to clean the text data.

**Feature Engineering:**
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converted text data into numerical features using TF-IDF.

Additional Features: Extracted Part-of-Speech (POS) tags, sentiment scores (polarity and subjectivity), and Word2Vec embeddings to enrich the feature set.

**Modeling:**
SVM Model: Trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using the processed features to classify the emotional intensity.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters, aiming to improve performance.

**Evaluation:**
Performance Metrics: Evaluated the model using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
Cross-Validation: Performed cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness across different data splits.
